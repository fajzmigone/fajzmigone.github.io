### Welcome to my website!

Economist and statistician with a passion for data analysis and economic development. Since February 2021, I have been working at the National Agency of Statistics (ANSTAT) of CÃ´te d'Ivoire as an economist and statistician, responsible for issues related to reform and innovation. I also handle topics related to AI and Big Data within the institute. My role involves analyzing economic data and providing essential information for decision-making.

Here, you will find my research work, exciting projects that occupy my time, and my reflections on the ivorian and west african economies.
