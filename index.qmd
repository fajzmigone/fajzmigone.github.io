### Hey, welcome !

Economist and statistician with a passion for data analysis and economic development. Since February 2021, I have been working at the National Agency of Statistics (ANSTAT) of Côte d'Ivoire , in charge of studies and survey for issues related to reform and innovation.

My professional roles are : (i) Deputy Director in charge of Methodological Innovation and (ii) Head of DataLaB, the Data Innovation Lab of ANSTAT.

My interest are related to AI, Big Data on one hand and Labor Market and Poverty on the other hand. My role involves analyzing economic data and providing essential information for decision-making.

Here, you will find my research work, exciting projects that occupy my time, and my reflections on the ivorian and west african economies.
