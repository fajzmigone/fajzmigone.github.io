## Job Quality and Poverty in developping countries : Evidence from Côte d'Ivoire

<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jo8JqBBzvfliCmEQC0UG4NHShR-NiNCe/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Working Paper</a> <br>

This study analyzes the influence of household members’ job quality on the household poverty status in Côte d'Ivoire using data from the 2018 Harmonized Survey of Household Living Conditions. Using simple
probit regressions, this study highlights the significant negative effect of a household head’s job quality on
household poverty risk. It also shows that improving the job quality of other household members reduces
the risk of household poverty. In addition to promoting improved employment conditions for workers,
policymakers should promote women's access to high-quality jobs. This could involve investing in social
facilities to relieve the burden of caring for children in the household.

This study, using a double-difference methodology and propensity score matching (PSMs), analyses
the causal impact of Mali's prolonged crises and conflicts on the Malian education system. The
results indicate that these events have had a significant and negative impact on education, resulting
in a drop in the average number of years of education between the generations that attended school
during the conflict and the previous generation, ranging from 1.13 to 1.97 years of education. These
findings underline the urgency of taking measures to mitigate these adverse effects and re-establish
a functional education system in the country, highlighting the importance of understanding the
causal impact of the crises on education in Mali.
