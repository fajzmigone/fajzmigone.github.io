My goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the cultures and histories of these peoples by studying their languages. Currently, I am working on a monograph that explores the linguistic roots of the Elvish languages. Through extensive research and analysis, I hope to shed light on the connections between the different dialects of Elvish and their origins. This project has been particularly challenging, as Elvish is a complex and nuanced language, but I am determined to see it through to completion."

Using simple probit regressions, this study highlights the significant negative effect of a household head’s job quality on household poverty risk. It also shows that improving the job quality of other household members reduces the risk of household poverty. In addition to promoting improved employment conditions for workers, policymakers should promote women’s access to high-quality jobs. This could involve investing in social facilities to relieve the burden of caring for children in the household. —-"

The results indicate that these events have had a significant and negative impact on education, resulting in a drop in the average number of years of education between the generations that attended school during the conflict and the previous generation, ranging from 1.13 to 1.97 years of education. These findings underline the urgency of taking measures to mitigate these adverse effects and re-establish a functional education system in the country, highlighting the importance of understanding the causal impact of the crises on education in Mali."
