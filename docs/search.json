Using simple probit regressions, this study highlights the significant negative effect of a household head’s job quality on household poverty risk. It also shows that improving the job quality of other household members reduces the risk of household poverty. In addition to promoting improved employment conditions for workers, policymakers should promote women’s access to high-quality jobs. This could involve investing in social facilities to relieve the burden of caring for children in the household. —-"

The results indicate that these events have had a significant and negative impact on education, resulting in a drop in the average number of years of education between the generations that attended school during the conflict and the previous generation, ranging from 1.13 to 1.97 years of education. These findings underline the urgency of taking measures to mitigate these adverse effects and re-establish a functional education system in the country, highlighting the importance of understanding the causal impact of the crises on education in Mali."

Researchers have identified a negative association between exposure to violence and academic performance in children, with violence manifesting in various forms. Using data from the 2018 Violence Against Children Survey (VACS), we analyze the effects of exposure to violence on academic performance of children aged 13 to 18 in Côte d’Ivoire. Our results indicate that children exposed to violence are more likely to experience academic difficulties, such as grade repetition and school dropout, leading to poor academic performance. Furthermore, the literature demonstrates that these effects are not limited to academic outcomes but also impact children’s emotional and social well-being. This study highlights the importance of educational policies and child protection measures aimed at reducing exposure to violence and improving children’s academic performance in Côte d’Ivoire."

    "text": "# Price Range Validation System\n## Technical Documentation\n### 1. Overview\nThis document describes a data validation system implemented in Python that processes product pricing data and validates it against predefined price ranges. The system reads historical data from Excel files, establishes valid price ranges for products, and cleanses new data based on these ranges.\n### 2. System Architecture\n#### 2.1 File Structure\nThe system operates on the following directory structure:\n```\nProject/\n├── Data_correction1/\n│   ├── juin/\n│   │   └── A_Data_Scrapping_juin.xlsx\n│   └── juillet/\n│       └── [daily files].xlsx\n└── Data_Correction2/\n    └── juillet/\n        └── [cleaned files].xlsx\n```\n#### 2.2 Data Flow\n1. Read reference data from previous month (June)\n2. Create price range dictionary\n3. Process current month’s data (July)\n4. Output cleaned data files\n### 3. Detailed Implementation\n#### 3.1 Reference Data Loading\n```python\nprevious_month_file = os.path.join(“Data_correction1”, “juin”, “A_Data_Scrapping_juin.xlsx”)\naggregated_df = pd.read_excel(previous_month_file)\n```\nThis code loads the reference data containing valid price ranges for products from the June dataset.\n#### 3.2 Price Range Dictionary Creation\n```python\nprice_ranges = {}\nfor _, row in aggregated_df.iterrows():\n    lower_bound, upper_bound = map(float, row[‘fourchette’].split(‘-’))\n    price_ranges[row[‘Libelle_du_produit’]] = (lower_bound, upper_bound)\n```\nThe system creates a dictionary where:\n- Key: Product name (`Libelle_du_produit`)\n- Value: Tuple of (lower_bound, upper_bound)\nMathematical representation:\nLet P be the set of products and R be the set of valid ranges:\n```\nP = {p₁, p₂, ..., pₙ}\nR = {(l₁, u₁), (l₂, u₂), ..., (lₙ, uₙ)}\n```\nwhere lᵢ and uᵢ represent the lower and upper bounds for product pᵢ.\n#### 3.3 Price Validation Function\n```python\ndef is_within_range(product, price):\n    if product not in price_ranges:\n        return None\n    lower_bound, upper_bound = price_ranges[product]\n    return lower_bound &lt;= price &lt;= upper_bound\n```\nMathematical formulation:\nFor a given product p and price x:\n```\nV(p,x) = {\n    True  if l ≤ x ≤ u\n    False if x &lt; l or x &gt; u\n    None  if p ∉ P\n}\n```\nwhere (l,u) is the price range for product p.\n#### 3.4 Data Processing Logic\nThe system processes daily files using the following algorithm:\n1. For each Excel file in the July directory:\n   - Load the daily data\n   - Initialize status and anomaly columns\n   - Process each row:\n     - If product exists in reference data:\n       - Validate price\n       - If invalid, set price to None\n     - If product doesn’t exist:\n       - Skip row\n   - Save cleaned data\nPseudo-algorithm:\n```\nFOR each file F in july_directory:\n    D ← read_excel(F)\n    D’ ← empty_dataframe()\n    FOR each row r in D:\n        IF r.product ∈ price_ranges:\n            IF not is_within_range(r.product, r.price):\n                r.price ← NULL\n            D’.append(r)\n    save_excel(D’, output_directory)\n```\n### 4. System Constraints and Assumptions\n1. Input Data Format:\n   - Excel files (.xlsx)\n   - Required columns:\n     - Libelle_du_produit (Product name)\n     - Prix_du_produit (Product price)\n     - fourchette (Price range in format “lower-upper”)\n2. Price Range Format:\n   - String format: “X-Y”\n   - X and Y are floating-point numbers\n   - X &lt; Y (lower bound less than upper bound)\n3. Data Validation Rules:\n   - Prices must be numeric\n   - Prices must fall within specified ranges\n   - Products must exist in reference data\n### 5. Output Specifications\nThe system generates cleaned Excel files with the following modifications:\n- Invalid prices are set to None\n- Products not in reference data are excluded\n- Original file structure is maintained\n- Additional columns:\n  - status: Validation status\n  - Valeur_Atypique: Anomaly indicator\n### 6. Error Handling\nThe system handles the following cases:\n1. Missing products in reference data\n2. Invalid price values\n3. Out-of-range prices\n4. Missing or malformed input files\n### 7. Performance Considerations\nThe system uses dictionary lookup for price ranges, providing O(1) access time for product validation. The overall complexity is O(n×m) where:\n- n = number of daily files\n- m = number of rows per file\n### 8. Future Enhancements\nPotential improvements could include:\n1. Parallel processing of daily files\n2. Advanced anomaly detection\n3. Automated reporting system\n4. Dynamic price range updates\n5. Data visualization capabilities"
